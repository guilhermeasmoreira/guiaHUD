# Poké Idle Clan HUD

Visual references for the planned Fogo, Malefic, and Gelo themes are saved in [design/README.md](design/README.md). The current extension still uses Padrão minimalista.

Chrome Manifest V3 extension that presents the compact **Padrão minimalista** HUD for Poké Idle Online. It reads values from the game's existing DOM and forwards actions to original controls.

Version 0.4 adds a fully custom, expandable team selector with the game's Pokémon sprites, HP, level, and active-state feedback. It also applies the minimal theme's scrollbar to the skills row and every other scrollable game surface while the HUD is enabled.

## Load in Chrome

1. Open Chrome's Extensions page and enable Developer mode.
2. Choose Load unpacked and select the repository root folder, the one containing `manifest.json` (not `src`).
3. Open https://pokeidle.online/game/.
4. Use the gear button to change the compact setting or disable the HUD. When disabled, the small Ativar HUD button restores it without reloading.

The extension only matches the game page and requests the storage permission for its own settings. After pulling an update, click **Reload** on the extension in `chrome://extensions/`, then refresh the game tab.

## Manual regression checklist

- Confirm the top menu becomes a compact command bar and **Helper** opens the game's original Auto Helper.
- Confirm the compact chat control opens and closes the original themed chat without leaving a duplicate control.
- Confirm the original trainer/team panel is hidden. Click the trainer name in the compact profile, check the minimal Pokémon list and sprites, select another Pokémon, then confirm the list closes and the active name updates.
- Confirm horizontal and vertical scrollbars use the minimal style, especially the skills row and the expanded Pokémon list.
- Confirm skill cooldown values appear and update using the game's own cooldown display.
- Click **Zerar** in Hunt Analyzer; the original analyzer opens as needed, and its own confirmation control completes the reset.
- Confirm target, Boss, and Hunt Analyzer values continue updating during play.

## Structure

- src/adapter: centralized game selectors and normalized live state.
- src/state: normalized state store.
- src/bridge: clicks original game controls for menu, skills, boss, and Hunt Analyzer actions.
- src/hud: compact profile/target, boss, analyzer, menu, and skills components.
- src/themes: shared layout and the Padrão minimalista theme.
- src/settings: extension-owned preferences and enable/disable controls.
- tests: parser and adapter tests using a small fixture-like DOM.

## Checks

Run npm test with Node.js. The adapter is also available in the DevTools console when the content-script execution context is selected as PokeClanHUD; PokeClanHUD.debug() reports which game roots were detected and PokeClanHUD.refresh() refreshes the displayed state.

Live regression still needs to be checked in the running game, especially menu action names and the game's expanded Hunt Analyzer and Boss behavior.
